# counters

To Deploy --> elm make src/Main.elm

I am going to build a simple counter program but with multiple counters tracked by index in the model list of ints.  It is cool because you can indexedmap over the model to access the required counter data.  This is done in both the view and update functions.  I guess this means that lists in Elm retain their order. Start by creating a sandbox with initial model of two zeroed counter representations (Int).  The messages are all coming from user interaction with the view (Html events). A view helper fn isolates each counter and associated control buttons.  Take note of the higher level programming going on here when the viewCounter's arguments are auto filled in with an index and the contained type in the List, by the function call to indexedMapped in the List module.
